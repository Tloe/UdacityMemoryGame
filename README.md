## How to play the game

This is a classic card memory game. Click on the cards to open them and match all the cards to win the game.
Reset either at the end or by pressing the restart button.
One move is counted as guessing or matching two cards. The first star drops at 12 moves and the second star drops at 17 moves.
At the top there is a timer showing how long the game has been running for.
